# Enem calculator
Last year I was studying for the entrance exams of brazilian universities and one specific exam is the ENEM , the national high school exam , has a particular technique to do your grade. So I did a code to make this easier to do this grade.

## Instructions :

First of all, you need to take your grades in the INEP website

After this, you must create a txt file called "notas_enem.txt" in the same folder that you put the code, donÂ´t forget to keep this extension. In this file you put your grades like this, KEEP THE SUBJECTS ORDER:

Now you can run the code, the code will ask the weights of the course that you deserve, you can find it in the university website.
Put them and you grade is there

After this the code will ask if you want to save :

If the answer is "yes" put a letter 's' and write a description about this grade.
